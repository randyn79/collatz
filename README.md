#Collatz Conjecture
Known by various names, the Collatz Conjecture is a mathematical problem in which you take any given positive integer and:
* If it is even, divide by 2, -OR-
* If it is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.

Research done by others indicate this will always eventually result in a an endless 4, 2, 1 loop.

The purpose of this project is not to solve the Collatz Conjecture, but to gather data and statistics (as well as for me to practice Python and git).

The initial commit includes functions to:
* Perform the basic math to create a list/sequence for given numbers
* Create a list of the prime numbers in this sequence
* Create lists of even and odd numbers in this sequence
* Creates a dictionary of the frequencies of each numbers in this sequence
